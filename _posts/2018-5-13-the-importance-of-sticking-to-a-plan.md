title: The importance of sticking to a plan
---

In the last article I wrote about how vital to successfull execution is thinking and working fast and dirty until you have a clear vision about the product. This, though true, can be understood wrong.

The phylosophy behind fast execution is not just doing random things fast and dirty. It's doing the RIGHT things fast and dirty. You see the difference?

Now I want to extend that idea and share some words with you about something I firmly beleive in - the importance of sticking to a plan.

In the heads of many people scary pictures arise when they hear the words "plan" or "planning". And I understand that, because we, as human beings, truly insist on making things difficult and complex. It's part of our nature, because when we understand and achieve something that for many others seems extremely hard, we feel proud of ourselves. It's a deep psychological thing.

Now, in reality, planning is super, super simple thing, but at the same time - hugely important. You have probably heard the saying "If you don't know where you're going, any road'll take you there". I can't stress enough how true this is. You have to know your master goal in mind.

So, let's break the stupid cliches and see what an actual plan is and has to be.

Let's say you want to make a trip this year. So, you sit down with your phone and open up your notepad. Here's an example of what your plan for the trip would look like.

> Trip to Canada
1. Save $3000 - $500 each month in the next 6 months;
2. Find a hotel and book a room for 7 days;
3. Make a map/list with the things we should visit;
4. Make a list with some phone numbers for emergency cases there;
5. Buy tickets and have fun.

Well, that's the plan. Simple, right? I bet you expected a list with 20 items with 10 subitems each or some fancy structure with graphics etc. But why? A trip is a fun thing and you don't have to make it complex or stressfull. Make sure the basics are sorted out, the other is details, don't sacrifice the excitement.

Here's another example of how I would make a plan for an idea that poped up to my mind and it's execution.

> Idea: fitness app
1. Make a simple market research;
  - what are other fitness apps on the apps stores out there;
  - what is the common between them and what I can make to stand out;
  - decide what's my market focus - the ideal customer that I'd like to reach;
2. Draw the app's flow;
3. Make a git repo;
4. Develop the app's structure/basic flow - user authentication, core functionality (adding workouts/excercises, tracking progress) - do it fast, ugly and dirty;
5. Make a lending page and validate the idea;
6. Polish the most important things that doesn't look good right now;
7. Plan again, based on the current state of the project.

See what I did here? I bring a little bit more complexity, but just the right amount so my plan is clear, motivating and DOESN'T STRESS ME OUT when I look at it. Building software is not a simple thing, so why make it more complex by thinking and trying to sort out everything in the beginning? I don't need that additional complexity. So, in point 7 I'm being a bit strategic, by advising myself to rethink the plan and tweak it when I have a more clear vision about the project later on. It's a trick that I like to use to bring some "air" and flexibility to the plan.

The key thing here to rebember is that you're not obligated to come with the entire plan from start to finish. You just have to have some sort of simple, managable and meaningful enough for you steps just to START DOING things with some level of direction and meaning. This is the core idea of planning in general. The plan should be able to motivate you to wake up and do the right work.

So, it doesn't matter if you plan for a trip or a new business/project - you have to have some sort of vision about where you're heading from here. It's not a "nice to have" thing. The plan is a "must" thing. Otherwise you're doing random things and end up acheiving random goals in random places with random people and random results. It's not what we're trying to do as wise humans.

Now, fire up a simple editor and write down the next 3-5 simple steps towards your goal. It's refreshing and at the same time motivational activity. It's something you cannot allow yourself to skip.

So, what's your plan?
