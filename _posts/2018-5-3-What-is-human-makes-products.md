title: What is Human Makes Products

### What is Human Makes Products?
Human Makes Products is the web spot, where I document my journey through the unknown, trying to make meaningful side projects and hustling to bring them to the people. My main goal with Human Makes Products is to share my experience and knowledge about the process and at the same time hold myself accountable for sticking to it and learning to accept it and love it.

It's kind of my personal way to reflect and meditate on my progress.

### Why should I care?
> “Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.”
  ― Eleanor Roosevelt

Each continual activity towards some goal consists of at least three things - failures, victories (small and big ones) and lessons. There is a big chance you can maximize the victories and minimize the failures with the same amount of lessons you gain out of the entire process. The way you do is by learning from the mistakes of others.

I have learned many things from the openly sharing communities out there - be it in the area of software development, fitness, productivity or life in general. That's why I feel the urge to give back the things I've learnt, am learning and will learn in my journey of building side projects.

### What should I expect from this journal?
Basically everything that I encounter throughout the process and found some value in it. This includes practical stuff from the field of software development, marketing and product management to general life topics as productivity, emotions, time management, work-life balance, fitness/physical condition etc., etc.

Think of Human Makes Products as curated selection of life/business lessons with an accent on becoming better human being.

### So, do you have a plan?
Of course I have and it's pretty simple. Write a single post each week, summarizing thoughts, lessons and things that happened during it. That's it.

Sounds cool? Subscribe for my newsletter to send you the latest posts directly in your inbox. And of course, spamming is not my goal, so feel safe ;)

OK. Let the journey begin.
