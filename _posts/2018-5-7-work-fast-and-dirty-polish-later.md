title: Work fast and dirty, polish later
---

Remember: you should strive to face the potential difficulties as soon as possible. Whether you're developing a new feature of a product or entirely new business, your main focus should be on executing fast and dirty. I'm telling you that from personal experience.

I have made the mistake of focusing too much on details. I remember how hard for me it was to accept that being so much drawned in making things perfect is actually the thing, that was stopping me from building damn things at all. I have always beleived that one should do his work the best way he can. That he must always give 100% of his attention to the small details, because small details make the difference. But at the end of the day, if you have the perfect details sorted out and the product of your work as a whole seems a facinating collection of nicely done "small elements" without a meaningful connection between them, it's pointless and pretty dissapointing. Something like having a Porsche in parts - it's cool but useless.

Now I use a more strategical approach when developing things. The process can be summarized in five steps.

1. Come up with an idea and decide which are the 100% essential parts of it. Those are the things, that without them, your product/business/idea/feature would be pointless;
2. Execute these "essential parts" as fast and dirty as you can;
3. Make sure the thing is working properly, or if it's an idea or business - make sure it's validated (by yourself or by your target audience);
4. Polish the thing you've built;
5. Execute again with the next important thing.

> Remember: you should strive to face the potential difficulties as soon as possible.

Following the above process you're focusing on execution and usability, not so much about form and beauty. That way you're going to face and resolve your difficulties ASAP, so that you have time for the important things. At the end of the day, a product/idea/functionality should be working and satisfying needs. So keep the focus on execution. Develop as simple as possible, remove the useless stuff and make people happy. That's your goal as a human being.
