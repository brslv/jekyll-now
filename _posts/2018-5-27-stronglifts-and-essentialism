title: Stronglifts and essentialism
---
Let me tell you about Stronglifts 5x5.

Stronglifts 5x5 is a fitness program that gained massive popularity because of it's simplicity and proven results. It consists of only 6 excercises. There is no leg day, chest day, bicep or tricep day. 

Stronglifts 5x5 focuses on the four most basic compound movements - squat, bench press, OHP (over head press), deadlift - that you do in every workout. Doing only these four movements and applying progressive overload technique (increasing the weight on each exercise by 2.5 kilos every workout) is enough to gain muscles and become stronger.

Squats, bench press, OHP and deadlifts are so fundamental exercises, that some would say these are like the fitness alphabet - everyone related to some kind of body building should know it and use it.

So, I started with stronglifts on 1 May and already see the power of this simplistic approach to fitness. I feel much more energetic, stronger and the most important of all - progressing. It really boils down to focusing on the essentials and becoming the best you can be in these most important exercises.

Looking back to the previous experiences in my life, I can say with big certainty that sticking to basics and perfecting them is crucial for success in every area, not just fitness. I would suggest that you should always look for the essentials - this is what brings the most of the value to our lives. Remove all the useless and unnecessary things that you have, do or consider doing. Also, be mindful that if something seems too complex, it may be not that essential for your process. Be very conscious and selective when you bring more complexity to your life.

Be it fitness or any other area in your life, don't overcomplicate things. Achieve the most with less. Be clever.
