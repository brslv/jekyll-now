Hey, there, my name is Bobby. I'm from Sofia, Bulgaria.

There's a short story I'd like to share with you.

I love building things. All kind of things. I remember how it all started. When I was young I had a strong drawing obsession. I was drawing amazing back than. It was that time, when I cultivated my love for details and learnt to be patient and calm in the process of creating. But drawing was just fun and relaxing activity and nothing more.

So later I expanded my skills into the more practical fields of graphic and web design. For the next three years in the school I was doing this as my main hobby and source of small income, having some friends and some of their friends as my clients, making small websites and print stuff.

Years passed by and I graduated marketing. I was really loving it, but at that time another thing, that later became my main source of income, grabbed my attention - programming. Having skills at Photoshop, I was able to design the most amazing website, but couldn't bring it to life. I had to learn how to do this, too. During my exploration of the endless fields of building software, I have worked for some time as a copywriter at one of the best digital agencies back then. Later I found it was not for me - it was too boring. This was the period in my life, when the confusion and hesitation ruled my consciousness.

Finally, I made the decision to stop fooling myself and trust my heart. I devoted my whole energy to creating software. I started my first job as a backend developer, where I learnt that this field is really hard (much harder than I imagined), but at the end the day very exciting and fun. There I met amazing people, which learnt me a whole lot of things and guided me in the process.

Year and a half later I changed my job and became a frontend developer at a company, making online gambling/casino games. It was very valuable time there and maybe the first time I felt like being a real developer.

Again, year later I moved on and here I am currently working as a senior frontend developer in another company, making online trading software.

Throughout the entire journey, one thing I was constantly doing - side projects. Many of them. And though the most of them never survived to production, I was constantly observing and learning from my mistakes.

To this date I have a pretty big collection of lessons, thoughts and tips that I feel the urge to share. And you know what? I'm still doing side projects and still learning, struggling, and having fun at the same time. If you're like me and love building things and providing our society with better solutions, I hope you might find something inspiring here in my blog.
